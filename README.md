# Automated Fluid Dispenser - APSC 101 Engineering Design Project

## Overview
This repository contains the design files, CAD models, and supporting documentation for the Automated Fluid Dispenser project, created as part of the APSC 101 course at Queen's University. This project was my first engineering design project of my academic career, completed as a collaborative team effort.

## Project Context
The Automated Fluid Dispenser was designed to automate the process of dispensing precise amounts of fluid and powder. The project was developed in a team setting for the APSC 101 course, with each team member responsible for different aspects of the design and integration. I specifically focused on the final integration of all subsystems and was directly responsible for designing the mast structure, powder dispenser, and fluid dispenser systems.

## Repository Structure
- **CADParts/**: Contains individual CAD parts and sub-assemblies.
- **Drawings/**: Includes technical drawings of individual parts and assemblies.
- **Exploded Views/**: Contains exploded view illustrations of assemblies.
- **Part Files/**: Includes the main part files for the project.
- **Sketches/**: Contains concept sketches and early design iterations.

## Usage
- The CAD files are provided for reference and educational purposes.
- To view the assemblies, use a compatible CAD software (SolidWorks recommended).
- Due to missing part files, some assemblies may not appear complete.


## Important Notice
Please note that some SolidWorks part files have been lost or renamed over time, which may result in missing components in the CAD assembly files. This may affect the completeness of the assembly when viewed. This is due to file management challenges encountered over time.
